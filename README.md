## 📝 Project Description

This project was developed during the first year of my undergraduate studies.  
We explored a real-world dataset containing salary information of adults from different countries, aiming to uncover meaningful insights through:

- 🔍 Data filtering and segmentation  
- 📊 Visualization of income distribution across various demographics  
- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation  
- 📈 Drawing conclusions based on patterns in the data

The project focused on asking questions such as:  
- How does education level affect salary?  
- Are there differences in income based on gender?  
- Which countries tend to have higher income brackets?
